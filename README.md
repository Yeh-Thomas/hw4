How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
 
 38. The loop however runs 39 time, at the 39th time is when the for loop runs and
 realize it is over the "width - 10" then stops drawing.
 
What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?

1st 10 : sets var x as 10, so on x axis at 10

2nd 10 : width -10 is when the lines should stop

3rd 10 : var x increases by 10 each time 




How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
6 times for drawing the circles.

What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?

"i = i + 10" make the i increase more than 10.
(x.length - i)  x.length minus more than i.

How can you make the ellipse trail longer?

Adding more circles.
